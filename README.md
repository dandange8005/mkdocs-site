# About this repo

This is a demo github repository that contains a mkdocs + Material theme documentation site and deployed via Github.

The notes are published at https://dandange8005.github.io/mkdocs-site/ using Github pages.

The detail setup steps are documented in the [index](docs/index.md) file in the docs folder.

## Editing the Docs

### Editors

The documents are written in Markdown syntax. Feel free to use any text editor you want to edit the documents.

Personally I use the following editors to edit the documents

- VS code (with markdown preview)
- Obsidian

### Editing on the original local machine

The original machine will include the python library which will not be synched to Github as they will be added to the .gitignore file

#### Steps to make changes

run vscode
editing in vscode
commit the changes

### Editing remotely

There are a few options you can choose to edit the documents remotely

#### Run codespace via Github

- This would allow you to make changes to the repo and the docs within the browser

#### Clone the repo to your local machine

- Github desktop

- open up the repo with either obsidian, Marktext or VS code
