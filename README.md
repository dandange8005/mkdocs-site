This is my experimental github repository that uses Github and mkdocs + Material theme to publish my notes. 

The notes are published at https://dandange8005.github.io/mkdocs-test/ using Github pages.





## Editing the Docs

### Editors

You can choose whatever editor you want to make changes to the .md files as they use Markdown syntax.

However, these are some of the editors I would consider using

- VS code (with markdown preview)
- Obsidian

### Editing on the original local machine

The original machine will include the python library which will not be synched to Github as they will be added to the .gitignore file

#### Steps to make changes

run vs code
editing in vs code
commit the changes

### Editing remotely

There are a few options you can choose to edit the documents remotely

#### Run codespace via Github

- This would allow you to make changes to the repo and the docs within the browser

#### Clone the repo to your local machine

- Github desktop

- open up the repo with either obsidian, Marktext or VS code
