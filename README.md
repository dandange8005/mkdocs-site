# Mkdocs-test

a test repository using mkdocs + Material Template

You can visit the published test site at: https://dandange8005.github.io/mkdocs-test/

I followed this tutorial ([How To Create STUNNING Code Documentation With MkDocs Material Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-YA_dA8C20&list=WL&index=17&ab_channel=JamesWillett)) to create this project. 

Below are some of the benefits of creating a project like this:

- Write the documentation in simply [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) syntax (let you focus on writing the content not the style)

- Create a beatiful documentation site built with [MKDocs](mkdocs.org) and [Material for MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

- running a local server to test, preview the docs

- Github integration
  
  - version control
  
  - collaboration
  
  - track issues
  
  - [Github Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
  
  - doc deployed to Github pages and rendered with mkdocs + material for mkdocs
  
  - changes made locally or remotely all get published

- lots of great features from Material for MKDocs

## Dependencies

Here are some of the dependencies of the project

- Python

## Setup workflow

## Editing the Docs

### Editors

You can choose whatever editor you want to make changes to the .md files as they use Markdown syntax.

However, these are some of the editors I would consider using

- VS code
- [Marktext](https://github.com/marktext/marktext)
- Obsidian

### Editing on the original local machine

The original machine will include the python library which will not be synched to Github as they will be added to the .gitignore file

#### Steps to make changes

run vs code
editing in vs code
commit the changes

### Editing remotely

There are a few options you can choose to edit the documents remotely

#### Run codespace via Github

- This would allow you to make changes to the repo and the docs within the browser

#### Clone the repo to your local machine

- Github desktop

- open up the repo with either obsidian, Marktext or VS code
