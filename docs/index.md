## Why create a project like this?

In our DigEd team, we are often required to create documentations or guides for different purposes. In a recent project, we were tasked to create an online resource to help staff to move over to Blackboard Ultra courses. We ended up created the resource in Xerte which is a resource development tool for educators.

It was okay to use Xerte but there are some limitations:

- Xerte is not easy to collaborate with other team members
- There is no version control
- The search function is not great

Idealy, we'd like to create a documentation/knowledge base site that is easy to maintain, easy to update, easy to collaborate, and easy to publish.

Below are some of the benefits of creating a project like this:

- Write the documentation in simply [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) syntax (let you focus on writing the content not the style)
- Create a beatiful documentation site built with [MKDocs](mkdocs.org) and [Material for MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
- running a local server to test, preview the docs
- Github integration
  - version control
  - collaboration
  - track issues
  - [Github Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
  - doc deployed to Github pages and rendered with mkdocs + material for mkdocs theme
  - changes made locally or remotely all get published to the Github pages
- lots of great features from Material for MKDocs

## Github

I haven't started learning to use Git and GitHub until very recently. Here are some of the notes I took when I was learning Git and GitHub.

There are many benefits of using GitHub to host my notes and here are some of them:

- I don't need to worry about the losing of my notes as they are not just saved on my local computer, they are synched with the GitHub repo.
- I take advantages of GitHub to versioning my notes.
- I am able to work on my notes on multiple computers.
- I can collaborate with others on the same notes.
- I can publish my notes to the public.
- I can use GitHub to host my notes for free.

### MKDocs + Material for MKDocs

MKDdocs is a site generator for producing documentations. Material on the other hand makes it looks good.
