# Learn Git

This is where my learning journey begin with Git and GitHub.

I will be starting with the basics and then move on to more advanced topics. I will be using this repo to track my learning progress. 

## Tutorials

There are lots of online resources on Git and Github.

The main tutorial I am following to complete this repo is this one: [1.1: Introduction - Git and GitHub for Poets - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain)

I really like the style of this teacher and find the tutorial easy to follow.

Here is the video tutorial I am follow: [1.1: Introduction - Git and GitHub for Poets - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain)

The Markdown editor I am using for writing is [GitHub - marktext/marktext: üìùA simple and elegant markdown editor, available for Linux, macOS and Windows.](https://github.com/marktext/marktext)

- Simple, easy to use
- allow people to focus on writing without knowing much of markdown syntax

However this has not been maintained and updated for a while, therefore beaware the small bugs and issues it may cause.
