## GitHub Contribution Workflow

This project uses the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) workflow. This workflow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. It is a great workflow for small teams and for deploying to production often.

The GitHub Flow workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Create a branch

    When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time â€“ some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.
    
    When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas. Changes you make on a branch don't affect the main branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes, safe in the knowledge that your branch won't be merged until it's ready to be reviewed by someone you're collaborating with.
    
    When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of main as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
    
    > **Note:** You can also create branches from branches and create pull requests from branches. 

    ```bash
    # Create a new branch named "feature_x" and switch to it using:
    git checkout -b feature_x
    ```
        
    ```bash
    # Switch back to the main branch
    git checkout main
    ```
        
    ```bash
    # Delete the branch
    git branch -d feature_x
    ```
        
    ```bash
    # Push the branch to the remote repository
    git push origin feature_x
    ```
        
    ```bash
    # Push the branch to the remote repository and set the remote as upstream
    git push -u origin feature_x
    ```

2. Add commits

    adding commits is like saving changes. When you save changes, you commit them. Every commit has a commit message that describes what changed. These messages help you and others understand your commits when you're looking back through your project history.
    
    ```bash
    # Add all files to the staging area
    git add .
    ```
        
    ```bash
    # Add a file to the staging area
    git add <file>
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # commit the changes
    git commit -m "Commit message"
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # commit the changes and add all files to the staging area
    git commit -a -m "Commit message"

    # alternatively, you can use the following command
    git commit -am "Commit message"
    ```

3. Open a pull request

    open a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

    As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

    By using GitHub's @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they're down the hall or ten time zones away.

    You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It's a great way to learn the GitHub Flow before working on larger projects.

    ```bash
    # Create a pull request
    git pull-request
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Create a pull request and add a title
    git pull-request -m "Pull request title"
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Create a pull request and add a title and a description
    git pull-request -m "Pull request title" -b "Pull request description"
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Create a pull request and add a title, a description and assign a reviewer
    git pull-request -m "Pull request title" -b "Pull request description" -r "Reviewer"
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Create a pull request and add a title, a description, assign a reviewer and add a label
    git pull-request -m "Pull request title" -b "Pull request description" -r "Reviewer" -l "Label"
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Create a pull request and add a title, a description, assign a reviewer, add a label and set the milestone
    git pull-request -m "Pull request title" -b "Pull request description" -r "Reviewer" -l "Label" -m "Milestone"
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Create a pull request and add a title, a description, assign a reviewer, add a label, set the milestone and set the project
    git pull-request -m "Pull request title" -b "Pull request description" -r "Reviewer" -l "Label" -m "Milestone" -p "Project"
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Create a pull request and add a title, a description, assign a reviewer, add a label, set the milestone, set the project and set the assignee
    git pull-request -m "Pull request title" -b "Pull request description" -r "Reviewer" -l "Label" -m "Milestone" -p "Project" -a "Assignee"
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Create a pull request and add a title, a description, assign a reviewer, add a label, set the milestone, set the project, set the assignee and set the draft flag
    git pull-request -m "Pull request title" -b "Pull request description" -r "Reviewer" -l "Label" -m "Milestone" -p "Project" -a "Assignee" -d
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Create a pull request and add a title, a description, assign a reviewer, add a label, set the milestone, set the project, set the assignee, set the draft flag and set the reviewers
    git pull-request -m "Pull request title" -b "Pull request description" -r "Reviewer" -l "Label" -m "Milestone" -p "Project" -a "Assignee" -d -R "Reviewer"
    ```
    
    ```bash 
    # Create a pull request and add a title, a description, assign a reviewer, add a label, set the milestone, set the project, set the assignee, set the draft flag, set the reviewers and set the team reviewers
    git pull-request -m "Pull request title" -b "Pull request description" -r "Reviewer" -l "Label" -m "Milestone" -p "Project" -a "Assignee" -d -R "Reviewer" -T "Team"
    ```

4. Discuss and review your changes

    Discuss and review your changes with your team. You can comment on specific lines of code or on the pull request as a whole. You can also leave comments on commits. These conversations will help your team resolve issues and improve the quality of your code.

5. Merge

    Merge your changes into the main branch. Merge your pull request when you're satisfied with the changes and ready to complete the review.

    Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with a merge, into the main branch.

    ```bash
    # Merge the pull request
    git merge <branch>
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Merge the pull request and delete the branch
    git merge <branch> -d
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Merge the pull request and delete the branch remotely
    git merge <branch> -d -r
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Merge the pull request and delete the branch remotely and locally
    git merge <branch> -d -r -l
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Merge the pull request and delete the branch remotely, locally and force the deletion
    git merge <branch> -d -r -l -f
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Merge the pull request and delete the branch remotely, locally, force the deletion and set the commit message
    git merge <branch> -d -r -l -f -m "Commit message"
    ```

6. Celebrate

    Congratulations! You've successfully completed the GitHub Flow.

7. Repeat

    The GitHub Flow is great for teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. For environments where deployments are made on a less regular basis, you may want to use a different workflow.
