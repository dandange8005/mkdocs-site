title: Navigating Inside an Ultra Course
order: 2
---

The new, modern user interface allows you to navigate directly to all parts of an Ultra course from the three main areas: Course Content, Top Navigation Menu and Details and Actions. 

All of your course content appears in the main part of the page. When you open a piece of content, it slides out in a layer on top of the Course Content page. Close layers to go back to a previous spot in your course.

See the video for a full overview of the interface, and the expandable links below for more details:

1. The Top Navigation Menu - A fixed top navigation that gives you access to commonly used tools such as Calendar, Announcements, Discussions, Gradebook, Messages, Analytics and Groups.
2. Course (or Organisation) Staff - Core teaching staff who are enrolled as 'Instructors' on a module will automatically be featured in the 'Course staff' list. The instructor who's been assigned as Primary Instructor will always stay at the top of the list.
3. Details & Actions - Located at the right of the screen. This is where you can view module enrolments; add a module banner image; set the module availability and manage test question banks.
4. Student (or Participant) Preview - Visible to staff only. Staff can use this tool to see how their course will look and function to students.
5. Module Content area - This is where you build up your course content and course activities. Your new modules will contain template placeholders. See Planning your Content (and the Best Practice Example) for guidance on how to use the course template.
