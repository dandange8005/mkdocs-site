It's easy to add images to your documentation. But there are few ways to host images for your documentation.

1. hosting the images on your own server
2. hosting the images on Github
3. hosting the images on [Imgur](https://imgur.com/)
4. hosting the images on [Imgbb](https://imgbb.com/)

I would recommend hosting the images on Github or Imgur.
