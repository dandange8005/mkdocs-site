# Ultra Presentation for COMSC

## Introduction (page 1)

Thank you for inviting me to this event where I will be talking briefly about the Ultra project and give you a quick overview of the new Ultra Courses interface. I will also be showing you some of the new features and enhancements that are available in Ultra courses.


## Ultra Project Overview (page 2)

- major upgrade to Learning Central
- new, modern and intuitive user interface
- responsive user experience across different devices
- two phases
  - Phase 1: Ultra Base Navigation
  - Phase 2: Ultra Courses View

I would like to start off by giving you a brief overview of the Ultra project. The Ultra project is a major upgrade to Learning Central that will provide a new, modern and intuitive user interface for staff and students. It will also provide a more responsive user experience across different devices. The project is being delivered in two phases. Phase 1 is the upgrade to Ultra Base Navigation and Phase 2 is the upgrade to Ultra Cources View.

### What is the Ultra Courses? (page 3)

- A new, modern and intuitive user interface
- A more responsive user experience across different devices
- A new way of working with Learning Central

Blackboard has been working on a new version of Learn called Ultra Courses. It provides a new experience that is designed to be more intuitive and easier to use. It is also designed to be more mobile friendly and responsive to different screen sizes. At its heart, the new design retains core Learning Central functionality, but it also introduces new features alongside a more intuitive interface with less complicated workflows.

### Why the move to Ultra? (page 4)

- Learning central has been around for a long time
- Students are expecting a more modern and intuitive user interface
- Blackboard stopped actively developing the original Learn interface
- We want to take advantage of the latest features and enhancements

Learning Central has been around for a long time and has remained largely unchanged over the years. student experience has changed significantly over the years and they are now expecting a more modern and intuitive user interface. Since 2012, Blackboard stopped actively developing the original Learn interface and has since focused on developing the Ultra experience. With Ultra courses now being the default experience for new Blackboard customers, it is important that we move to Ultra courses to ensure that we are able to take advantage of the latest features and enhancements. With Ultra, we are also receiving monthly updates and new features are being added all the time.

### How will this be implemented? (page 5)

- Phased approach
- Full roll-out in September 2023
- Consultation with schools to identify specific requirements
- Named Ultra contacts

So we took a phased approach to the implementation of Ultra courses. We started off with a small-scale pilot with six schools in spring 2022; We then launched a broader targeted roll-out with seven Schools for the 2022/23 academic year; and a small number of modules in a further 13 schools for the spring 2023 semester. We are now in phase 3 of the project where we are planning to move to the Ultra Courses View in September 2023.

We are now in consultation with the schools to plan the move to Ultra Courses View in September 2023. We are also working with the schools to identify any specific requirements and to ensure that the transition is as smooth as possible.

Each school will also have a named contact in the Digital Education Team who will identify and address specific school requirements and coordinate training, support and resources needs.


### How can staff prepare for the change? (page 6)

So how can you prepare for the change? Well, there are a number of things you can do to prepare for the change.

- Get familiar with the new interface
- Explore the resources available
- Attend training sessions
- engage with the Digital Education Team

You can started off by getting familiar with the new interface when you have access to your own modules. 

We've created a number of resources to help you get started with Ultra courses. You are welcome to explore these resources at your own pace.

We have also scheduled a number of training sessions to help you move to Ultra courses.

Most importantly, please engage with the Digital Education Team to discuss any specific issues or requirements you may have.

## Ultra Courses in Action  (page 7)

Now that you have a better understanding of the Ultra project, I would like to show you an Ultra course in action. I will be using a demo course to show you some of the new features.


### Ultra courses interface (page 8)

- clean and modern interface

When you first access the course, you will land on Course Content page. As you can see the editable left-hand menu present throughout all Learning Central modules has been removed, with content now displayed within the Course Content section to provide a simplified workflow for you and reduce the risk of students being unable to find material.


- Top navigation bar
A fixed top navigation that gives you access to commonly used tools such as Calendar, Discussions, Gradebook, Messages and Analytics.

- Course Staff
Core teaching staff who are enrolled as 'Instructors' on a module will automatically be featured in the 'Course staff' list. The instructor who's been assigned as Primary Instructor will always stay at the top of the list.

- Details & Actions
This is where you can view module enrolments; create and manage groups; add a module banner image; set the module availability; access, and create Blackboard Collaborate virtual classroom sessions; post announcements; manage test question banks; and add a module schedule.

- Course Content

This is where you build up your course content and course activities. You can organise content using folders or learning modules, which can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on them. You can drag and drop files directly into the area or within a folder. You can also add different course activities such as assignments, tests, discussions, and Blackboard Collaborate sessions. You can also add a description to each folder or learning module to provide students with additional information about the content contained within it. This is particularly useful if you are using learning modules to organise content, as it enables you to provide students with an overview of the moduleâ€™s content and learning outcomes.

- Student preview

You can use student preview to check that your course is working as expected and that students can access all the content and activities. Once finished the preview, you can exit the student preview mode by clicking on the exit preview button in the top right-hand corner of the screen. You can also reset the student preview by clicking on the Discard button. If you choose to Discard the information, your student preview will be removed without trace. However if you choose to Save, all activity will remain visible in the course. 

### four main icons (page 9)

Generally there are four main icons you will find throughout the Ultra Course View. These are:

- The plus icon
  it is how you add things. It is often found in the centre of a line where it will turn pink when moused over. 

- The pencil icon
  this indicates that something can be edited. You will see it when you mouse over text that can be edited such as document titles.

- The Cog icon
  this is the settings icon which will open the setting panel.

- three dots icon
  this denotes more and clicking on it will open a contextual menu. It is often found at the end of a line where it will turn pink when moused over.

### New Module Template (page 10)

All Ultra courses will be created using a new module template. The template has been designed to assist staff with structuring their new modules and to provide a consistent method of navigation for students across the institution. The template should be followed wherever possible, although staff can refine to suit their teaching if necessary. 

The template is made up of a number of sections, which are described below.

## Top Tips and features for using Ultra Courses (page 11)

Now that we've had a brief overview of the Ultra course interface. I would like to highlight some of the other new features that are available in Ultra courses.

### 1. Copy when you need to (page 12)

- No more module rollover
- Easier to build from scratch
- An opportunity to refresh and rebuild teaching areas
- Copy from rather than copy to
- Copy individual items rather than the entire course

Due to structural differences between the old and new module designs, it is not possible for the institution to automatically copy content (this process is often referred to as module rollover).

Feedback from other UK universities, and our own Ultra Course View pilot which took place during the 2022/23 academic year, has told us that most people find building a module from scratch in Ultra Course View is quicker than trying to copy a previous module in its entirety, and then updating material. This also gives you the opportunity to refresh and rebuild teaching areas, adding digitally accessible materials.

Rather than using the Course Copy to copy the entire course which has a high potential of resulting in error, we strongly recommend copying content only selectively, and checked thoroughly.


### 2. Learning modules and folders (page 13)

We talked about learning modules and folders earlier and that they can be used to organise content. They can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on them. But what is the difference between learning modules and folders and when should you use one than another?

Here are some of the difference between learning modules and folders

- Content can be navigated sequentially through a linear structure
- Can contain folders to help with organising larger amounts of content
- Can't be nested within folders

When Learning materials or course activities are placed within a Learning Modules, students can navigate the content sequentially through a linear structure, almost like an e-book, enhancing the 'flow' of reading and learning. Learning modules can also contain folders to help with organising larger amounts of content.

**Folders** are simply used to gather together multiple files in a single 'container'. We recommend placing module-wide reference materials and useful resources in a top level folder. 


### 3. Drag and drop files (page 14)

- files to folders/learning modules
- files to the content area
- images into the content editor

You can quickly add files to folders/learning modules viaÂ drag and drop. You can also drag and drop files from your computer to the content area to upload them. You can drag and drop images into the content editor to add them to your content.

### 4. Inline file rendering (page 15)

- word, pdf, powerpoint, excel, images, audio and video files
- no longer have to download files to view them

![Show example](https://help.blackboard.com/sites/default/files/images/2022-06/learn_ultra_student_CourseContent_InlineFileRendering_Documents.png)

Files such as word, pdf, powerpoint, excel, images, audio and video files can be viewed inline within the content area. This means that students no longer have to download files to view them.


### 5. Use Ultra Documents to build complex content (page 16)

- new way to build complex content
- Rich content
- Html content
- Marketplace content
- Reuse across multiple courses

Ultra documents are a new way to build complex content. They are a collection of text, images, videos, files, html content or content from the Marketplace that can be added to a course. They can be used to create a course outline, a course syllabus, a course introduction, a course overview, and can be reused across multiple courses.

### 6. Create meaningful content headings and descriptions (page 17)

- meaningful headings and descriptions
- search for content by title
- accessibility

When creating content, it is important to create meaningful headings and descriptions.

This is particularly important as Ultra now introduces a new feature that allows you to search for content by title.

It is also important for accessibility. Headings and descriptions help students navigate the content and understand the purpose of the content. They also help students with screen readers to understand the content.


### 7. Allow your students to track their progress (page 18)

- progress tracking
- see how your students are progressing through the course
- students can control their own progress
- staff can also see the progress of their students
 
The new progress tracking feature allows you to track the progress of your students. This is particularly useful if you want to see how your students are progressing through the course and if they are completing the required activities. The feature is enabled by default and can be accessed via the Progress Tracking option under Details and Action.

When progress tracking is on, students are able to see their progress in the course. They can use the circle icon next to each item to mark it as complete. Tests, Ultra Assignments and Discussion forums with a contribution are automatically marked as complete. 

Staff on the other hand can also see the progress of their students. clicking on the ellipsis icon next to each item will open a contextual menu where you can choose Participant Progress to see when each student has completed the item.

### 8. Personalise your modules (page 19)

- add a banner image
- add a personal profile picture

Ultra courses allow you to personalise your modules by adding a banner image and changing the title of the module. Having a course image not only make the module more visually appealing but also helps establish a strong course identity for your students.

All teaching staff added as instructors to the course will be listed in Course Staff with an avatar image. You can click your name in the left-hand menu of the homepage to access your profile page where you can add a profile picture and update your profile information.

### 9. Use Batch Edit to tidy up content (page 20)

Instead of deleting content, we recommend hiding it from students.

You should only delete content if it is something you no longer want to retain. An alternative is to hide the content from students. you can use the visibility setting to control the availability of the content as well as release it based on date, membership, or performance on other items.


### 10. Different ways to communicate with your students (page 21)

- Announcements
- Messages (Email in Original Course View)
- Discussion Forums
- feedback on Tests and Assignments
