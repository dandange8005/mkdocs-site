# Supporting the student journey through your module

This guide provides a list of things that we recommend implementing in your module to structure the learning journey and promote student engagement with the Learning Central module space. It may be that you
are already doing most, or all, of these things, but we hope this acts as a
useful aide memoir / checklist when preparing and delivering your module.

Please contact the [Digital Education Support Hub](mailto:digedsupport@cardiff.ac.uk) for further guidance on any of the below.

## Tell students about yourself and how/when you can help them

### Introduce yourself

A personal introduction at the beginning of your module, via Announcements in Learning Central, is strongly recommended.  This could be a video (i.e. Panopto), audio or text-based message or a combination. 

To help to create a connection with your students let them know a bit about you, your interests, expertise, experience and teaching approach.

## Make yourself available

Let students know when you are available for one-to-one support and guidance. In addition to a statement about availability in your profile, reminding students on a regular basis (in your weekly announcement, or elsewhere online) will help encourage participation. It is also a good idea to maintain consistent times each week if possible, offering flexibility if students can’t attend.

Consider what works best for both yourself and your students in terms of the practicalities – you could offer either face-to-face or online office hours, or a combination of both. You could also make use of online tools such as [Microsoft Bookings](https://intranet.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/supporting-your-work/it-support/collaborate-using-microsoft-365/using-microsoft-bookings) to allow students to book appointments easily.

### Post your profile and contact details

It is a good idea to have up to date profile(s) of yourself and the module teaching team in Learning Central. There is a Course Staff section in every module that is automatically populated with all staff who have the role of “module instructors”.

We recommend including your title, field of expertise, photo, contact details, and a brief biography, to help students get to know you.  Noting your pronouns (e.g., My pronouns are She/ Her) can also help create an inclusive culture, not just in your module but in the wider university. Clear expectations of when and how students can contact you and indicative response times are also really helpful.

## Help students to navigate the course

### Produce a weekly module map

Module Maps, which highlight the key activities students should focus on each week, have been very well received by students in recent years. They can provide clarity, guidance and direction to student activity during any given week. You can also provide links to materials, resources and activities so that students can easily access their learning in one place. This will help avoid any ambiguity and confusion, as well as reducing the number of students asking questions about what is expected. You can download a [module map template here](https://intranet.cardiff.ac.uk/intranet/staff/documents/cei-documents/Blank-weekly-module-map.docx) and read more about [module maps](https://intranet.cardiff.ac.uk/staff/supporting-your-work/teach-and-support-students/teach-and-assess-students/learning-and-teaching-development/digital-education-strategy/digital-learning-framework/weekly-module-map-template) on the intranet.

### Multiple means of representation

Try to provide a range of materials and resources in a variety of text, audio and video formats (with captions), to meet the range of needs of your students. Provide recordings, summaries of discussions and online forums to support asynchronous learning. Further information is available on the Universal Design page within the [Cardiff University Learning and Teaching Toolkit](https://xerte.cardiff.ac.uk/play_18569#PG1666970190851).

## Provide Assessment Support

### Explain module assessment components

Help students understand assessment expectations by including a clear explanation and breakdown of each component that makes up the module assessment, to the Assessment and Feedback area. This should be provided as early as possible in the module (where appropriate) and may simply entail uploading a copy of the assignment briefs. However, you could consider using an assessment map, a templates of which is available through the Blended Learning Framework.

### Put everything assessment related in one place

As well as assessment briefs and details about assessment, put all other summative assessment related items in the assessment and feedback area, organised and contextualised appropriately. Assessment is a key part of any module and using one place for anything related to this will make it much easier for students to find everything they need.

This could include rubrics, past papers, exemplars, instruction and any other support and guidance. You could consider recording a short Panopto video that talks students through the assessment components of the module, or focuses in on a particular assessment, and you could also provide a space (discussion board, Teams channel) for students to ask (and discuss) questions related to the assessments.

### Use the Reading List function

Use the Leganto reading list function to add all recommended (and ideally optional) reading and group this by week, topic or by using other logical grouping.  Being able to access any reading digitally can really help with accessibility of resources.  Using this reading list software has the potential to make accessing reading materials much more seamless as students can view lists and access digital copies in one place without having to make a new Library search each time they need to access a resource.

## Communicate regularly

### Use the announcements tool

The Announcements tool in Learning Central is the simplest, and usually most effective, method for keeping your students updated. Set your announcements to send an email concurrently as students may see that first.

You may want to post a brief written or video message at the beginning of each week highlighting and contextualising what’s being covered and what students need to do that week – you may want to reference the module map. Also consider an end of week message summarising the week and highlighting key contributions or addressing any questions that have arisen.

### Allow space for questions

As well as carving out time in face-to-face sessions for questions, allow students to ask questions of you, of each other, or discuss module content online and asynchronously. By having an open space for this you can encourage a sense of community in your module and possibly reduce the number of individual queries you get via email – it can be an efficient means of answering common questions once for the benefit of the whole cohort.

You could set up a Forum using the Discussion Board tool within Learning Central as an open area for students to ask questions throughout the module.  Alternatively, you could use Teams, Padlet, Mentimeter or another tool of your choice to receive questions or facilitate discussion.

Set clear expectations of how regularly you will check this space and give some indicative response times. You may also want to set expectations for students around interaction and etiquette - our [guide to online discussions](https://xerte.cardiff.ac.uk/play_12802#page1) includes advice on preparing students for online discussion, including a netiquette template you can repurpose for your own students.
